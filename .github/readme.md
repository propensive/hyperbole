# Hyperbole

__Assistance with Scala 3 metaprogramming__

Hyperbole is a nascent set of tools to make it easier to write macros in Scala.
To begin, it includes an `introspect` method which can provide useful
reflection detail about how the source of an expression translates into an AST.

## Features

- See a full introspection of an expression's AST
- Renders the AST structure in an easy-to-read tree format
- View source code alongside the AST
- Also view the "expanded" source code alongside, showing "invisible" syntax
- Produces output at compiletime or runtime, invoked inside or outside of a macro


## Availability







## Getting Started

Hyperbole runs at compiletime to expose the TASTy trees of expressions. It can be
invoked either from a macro, or within user code. In both cases, it produces a
single string showing a tabular representation of the TASTy tree, for displaying
in the console.

## Inside a Macro

Within a macro, where there is a `Quotes` instance available, any `Expr` value can
be introspected by calling its `introspect` extension method.

This will construct an instance of `Teletype`, a kind of string including ANSI
control codes. An ordinary `Text` value can be obtained using `Teletype#plain`,
which can be printed during compilation (as information or as an error), or
even used in the expansion of the macro.

## In Ordinary Code

The TASTy tree for any expression can also be obtained in ordinary code, using the
global `introspect` method.

For example, we can introspect the expression `1 + x`:
```scala
val x = 5
introspect(1 + x)
```
which will expand to the string,
```

â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â•´
â–ª Inlined                 1 + x    1.+(rs$line$2.x)
â””â”€â–ª Apply                 1 + x    1.+(rs$line$2.x)
  â”œâ”€â–ª Select      +       1 +      1.+
  â”‚ â””â”€â–ª Literal   1       1        1
  â””â”€â–ª Ident       x           x    rs$line$2.x
```

We could then compare the AST to a variant such as this:
```scala
val y: 5 = 5
introspect(y + 1)
```
which produces the simpler tree,
```

â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â•´
â–ª Inlined             y + 1    6
â””â”€â–ª Literal   6       y + 1    6
```
thanks to constant folding taking advantage of the singleton type of `y`.


## Status

Hyperbole is classified as __embryonic__. For reference, Soundness projects are
categorized into one of the following five stability levels:

- _embryonic_: for experimental or demonstrative purposes only, without any guarantees of longevity
- _fledgling_: of proven utility, seeking contributions, but liable to significant redesigns
- _maturescent_: major design decisions broady settled, seeking probatory adoption and refinement
- _dependable_: production-ready, subject to controlled ongoing maintenance and enhancement; tagged as version `1.0.0` or later
- _adamantine_: proven, reliable and production-ready, with no further breaking changes ever anticipated

Projects at any stability level, even _embryonic_ projects, can still be used,
as long as caution is taken to avoid a mismatch between the project's stability
level and the required stability and maintainability of your own project.

Hyperbole is designed to be _small_. Its entire source code currently consists
of 112 lines of code.

## Building

Hyperbole will ultimately be built by Fury, when it is published. In the
meantime, two possibilities are offered, however they are acknowledged to be
fragile, inadequately tested, and unsuitable for anything more than
experimentation. They are provided only for the necessity of providing _some_
answer to the question, "how can I try Hyperbole?".

1. *Copy the sources into your own project*
   
   Read the `fury` file in the repository root to understand Hyperbole's build
   structure, dependencies and source location; the file format should be short
   and quite intuitive. Copy the sources into a source directory in your own
   project, then repeat (recursively) for each of the dependencies.

   The sources are compiled against the latest nightly release of Scala 3.
   There should be no problem to compile the project together with all of its
   dependencies in a single compilation.

2. *Build with [Wrath](https://github.com/propensive/wrath/)*

   Wrath is a bootstrapping script for building Hyperbole and other projects in
   the absence of a fully-featured build tool. It is designed to read the `fury`
   file in the project directory, and produce a collection of JAR files which can
   be added to a classpath, by compiling the project and all of its dependencies,
   including the Scala compiler itself.
   
   Download the latest version of
   [`wrath`](https://github.com/propensive/wrath/releases/latest), make it
   executable, and add it to your path, for example by copying it to
   `/usr/local/bin/`.

   Clone this repository inside an empty directory, so that the build can
   safely make clones of repositories it depends on as _peers_ of `hyperbole`.
   Run `wrath -F` in the repository root. This will download and compile the
   latest version of Scala, as well as all of Hyperbole's dependencies.

   If the build was successful, the compiled JAR files can be found in the
   `.wrath/dist` directory.

## Contributing

Contributors to Hyperbole are welcome and encouraged. New contributors may like
to look for issues marked
[beginner](https://github.com/propensive/hyperbole/labels/beginner).

We suggest that all contributors read the [Contributing
Guide](/contributing.md) to make the process of contributing to Hyperbole
easier.

Please __do not__ contact project maintainers privately with questions unless
there is a good reason to keep them private. While it can be tempting to
repsond to such questions, private answers cannot be shared with a wider
audience, and it can result in duplication of effort.

## Name

_Hyperbole_ is a tool for working with macros (short for _macroinstructions_) whose name implies a largeâ€”or hyperbolicâ€”size.

In general, Soundness project names are always chosen with some rationale,
however it is usually frivolous. Each name is chosen for more for its
_uniqueness_ and _intrigue_ than its concision or catchiness, and there is no
bias towards names with positive or "nice" meaningsâ€”since many of the libraries
perform some quite unpleasant tasks.

Names should be English words, though many are obscure or archaic, and it
should be noted how willingly English adopts foreign words. Names are generally
of Greek or Latin origin, and have often arrived in English via a romance
language.
