No other _Scala One_ libraries are dependents of _Hyperbole_.

## Status

Hyperbole is classified as __embryonic__. For reference, Scala One projects are
categorized into one of the following five stability levels:

- _embryonic_: for experimental or demonstrative purposes only, without any guarantees of longevity
- _fledgling_: of proven utility, seeking contributions, but liable to significant redesigns
- _maturescent_: major design decisions broady settled, seeking probatory adoption and refinement
- _dependable_: production-ready, subject to controlled ongoing maintenance and enhancement; tagged as version `1.0` or later
- _adamantine_: proven, reliable and production-ready, with no further breaking changes ever anticipated

Projects at any stability level, even _embryonic_ projects, are still ready to
be used, but caution should be taken if there is a mismatch between the
project's stability level and the importance of your own project.

Hyperbole is designed to be _small_. Its entire source code currently consists
of 223 lines of code.

## Building

Hyperbole can be built on Linux or Mac OS with [Fury](/propensive/fury), however
the approach to building is currently in a state of flux, and is likely to
change.

## Contributing

Contributors to Hyperbole are welcome and encouraged. New contributors may like to look for issues marked

We suggest that all contributors read the [Contributing Guide](/contributing.md) to make the process of

Please __do not__ contact project maintainers privately with questions unless
there is a good reason to keep them private. While it can be tempting to
repsond to such questions, private answers cannot be shared with a wider
audience, and it can result in duplication of effort.
